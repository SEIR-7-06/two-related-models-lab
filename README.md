## Lab: Subdocuments/related models

### With your partner from yesterday:

1. Extend yesterday's lab, so that one model can contain the other
1. For example, if your models were `Singer` and `Song`: 
  * A `Singer` would "contain" `Song`s (just like an `Author` "contains" `Article`s)
1. See below for details


### Basic

1. Add Songs Array to Singer Model
1. Display Singers on New Song Page
1. Creating a new Song Pushes a Copy Onto Singer's Songs Array
1. Display Singer With Link on Song Show Page
1. Display Singer's Song With Links On Singer Show Page

### Advanced

1. Deleting an Song Updates An Singer's Songs List
1. Updating an Song Updates An Singer's Songs List
