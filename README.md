## Lab: Subdocuments/related models

### With your partner from yesterday:

1. Extend yesterday's lab, so that one model can contain the other
1. For example, if your models were `Singer` and `Song`: 
  * A `Singer` would "contain" `Song`s (just like an `Author` "contains" `Article`s)

>See below for details.  When we refer to `Singer` we mean whichever of your models form yesterday contains your other model.  Similarly, when we refer to `Song` we refer to the model that is contained by the other model.  Read carefully to make sure you're following the analogous step in your app.
